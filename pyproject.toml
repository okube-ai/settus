# The preference build system would have been flit, but setuptools had to be
# used to support `pip install git+http...` within Databricks. When trying
# to parse the version using flit, it needs to import the full package
# and some dependencies might be missing in the virtual environment.
# Setuptools allow to explicitly set the location of the version without
# having to import the package.
